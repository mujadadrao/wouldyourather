# Would You Rather ?

"Would you rather" is a conversation or party game that poses a dilemma in the form of a question beginning with 
"would you rather". The dilemma can be between two supposedly good options such as "Would you rather have the power 
of flight or the power of invisibility?", two attractive choices such as "Would you rather have money or have fame?", 
or two supposedly bad options such as "Would you rather sleep with your best friend's lover or your lover's
best friend?". The players, sometimes including the questioner, then must choose their answers. 
Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.
